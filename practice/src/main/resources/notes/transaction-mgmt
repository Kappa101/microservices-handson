What are Database Transactions?
A Database transaction is a
single logical unit of work which accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database.

AUTO-COMMIT::
=============
Auto-commit mode means that when a statement is completed,
 the method commit is called on that statement automatically.
  Auto-commit in effect makes every SQL statement a transaction

TRANSACTION::
=============
An application transaction is a sequence of application actions that are considered
    as a single logical unit by the application
If due to any reason any one of the above action fails
        then the other action should also be roll backed

NOTE::  By default the spring boot transaction is auto commit.
